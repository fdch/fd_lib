fd_lib 

Current version: 0.1

This is my personal [Pure Data](https://github.com/pure-data/pure-data) library of abstractions and externals. 
It has around 280 abstractions, 37 externals, shell scripts, and tutorials. 
For an overview of the library, go open '_overview.pd'
For instructions on how to compile see INSTALL.txt. 

fd_lib is now available via `deken`, Pure Data's package/externals manager. 
Open Pure Data and go to `Help > Find Externals`, then type `fd_lib` and download the binaries.

Use at your own risk and have fun!
