## fd_lib 

Current version: 0.1

This is my personal [Pure Data](https://github.com/pure-data/pure-data) library of abstractions and externals. It has around 264 abstractions, 54 externals, 12 shell scripts, and 2 tutorials. For an overview of the library, go to [OVERVIEW.md](OVERVIEW.md). For instructions on how to compile, go to [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md). 

`fd_lib` is now available via `deken`, Pure Data's package/externals manager. Open Pure Data and go to `Help > Find Externals`. Then type `fd_lib` and download the binaries. Only `macos` supported for now.

Use at your own risk and have fun!
