## Pd-messages helper files

This is an overview on how to interact with pd (create objects, connect lines, open patches, etc.) using messages. 

Basically everything in pd is a message. However, since some messages are only used by pd's gui, there is no documentation on how these work. There are some tutorials out there but some might be outdated. This overview is an attempt to bring this messages to the surface.

It is still on the makings, so any suggestions will be more than welcomed.

Best,

Fede
