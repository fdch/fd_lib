The call for context, for relation, for locality, is only valuable as long as it is also a radicalization of artistic authority, a breaking off of the artistic object as product, its fragmentation into an inoperative object."},"gsx$probs":{"$t":"18 100 45 73 54 3 50 7 15 12 0 29 7 15 0 51 79 6 6 39 0 0 93 66 39 25 29 0 0 0 0 29 40 83 73 48 54 30"},"gsx$quoteid":{"$t":"11/14/2017 9:11:14"}},{"id":{"$t":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/1tMkdssQlN_wbGS1SjfORS7AOBspKvvun7_AvzxctMrE/5/public/values/cssly"},"updated":{"$t":"2018-11-01T06:37:35.837Z"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006","term":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006#list"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"5/1/2018 16:54:43"},"content":{"type":"text","$t":"quote: Arendt’s rethinking of praxis is related to the more immediate task of delimiting the space of the political as the public realm in which human beings can act in concert in order to define themselves in historical terms., paraphrase: The space of the political belongs to the public sphere, in which humans carry out actions that define them in terms of history., probs: 9 43 33 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 17 0 24 0 0 37 12 0 0 0 0 0 51 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 12 90 0 33 0, quoteid: 11/14/2017 13:42:30"},"link":[{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/1tMkdssQlN_wbGS1SjfORS7AOBspKvvun7_AvzxctMrE/5/public/values/cssly"}],"gsx$timestamp":{"$t":"5/1/2018 16:54:43"},"gsx$quote":{"$t":"Arendt’s rethinking of praxis is related to the more immediate task of delimiting the space of the political as the public realm in which human beings can act in concert in order to define themselves in historical terms."},"gsx$paraphrase":{"$t":"The space of the political belongs to the public sphere, in which humans carry out actions that define them in terms of history."},"gsx$probs":{"$t":"9 43 33 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 17 0 24 0 0 37 12 0 0 0 0 0 51 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 12 90 0 33 0"},"gsx$quoteid":{"$t":"11/14/2017 13:42:30"}},{"id":{"$t":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/1tMkdssQlN_wbGS1SjfORS7AOBspKvvun7_AvzxctMrE/5/public/values/cu76f"},"updated":{"$t":"2018-11-01T06:37:35.837Z"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006","term":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006#list"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"5/2/2018 10:03:35"},"content":{"type":"text","$t":"quote: For Arendt, the term ‘public’ refers to the world itself, which can be related to all of the enduring artifacts fabricated by human hands and the many affairs that compose human experience, paraphrase: The public sphere is the world itself, where human action takes place in historical terms, probs: 0 38 52 7 9 0 2 8 0 0 0 0 0 31 0 0 42 9 0 42 0 0 0 25 1 0 0 0 26 9 9 33 0 0 100 10 60 17, quoteid: 11/14/2017 13:46:36"},"link":[{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/1tMkdssQlN_wbGS1SjfORS7AOBspKvvun7_AvzxctMrE/5/public/values/cu76f"}],"gsx$timestamp":{"$t":"5/2/2018 10:03:35"},"gsx$quote":{"$t":"For Arendt, the term ‘public’ refers to the world itself, which can be related to all of the enduring artifacts fabricated by human hands and the many affairs that compose human experience"},"gsx$paraphrase":{"$t":"The public sphere is the world itself, where human action takes place in historical terms"},"gsx$probs":{"$t":"0 38 52 7 9 0 2 8 0 0 0 0 0 31 0 0 42 9 0 42 0 0 0 25 1 0 0 0 26 9 9 33 0 0 100 10 60 17"},"gsx$quoteid":{"$t":"11/14/2017 13:46:36"}},{"id":{"$t":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/1tMkdssQlN_wbGS1SjfORS7AOBspKvvun7_AvzxctMrE/5/public/values/cvlqs"},"updated":{"$t":"2018-11-01T06:37:35.837Z"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006","term":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006#list"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"5/2/2018 10:49:54"},"content":{"type":"text","$t":"quote: Aesthetics has two 'modus operandi'.

It is a structure that persists while its content evolves and is displaced. The structure of the database comprises an initial condition for the evolution of a system. Evolution and displacement are fundamental to the dialogic process. Through this process all the possible meanings of stories, statements, images, and words interact, and possibly conflict, to affect and change their future meanings.

A database incorporates contradiction; it is simultaneously recombinant and indexical, precise and scalable, immersive and emergent, homogeneous and heterogeneous. It is a field of coherence and contradiction. The aesthetic dimensions of the database arise when an agent traverses this field of unresolved contradictions. The database is comprised of nested sub-fields, which are activated, and given ontological status by the agent’s trajectory through its field. Continuously emergent ontological states resolve as new sub-fields from each interaction and are integrated into the field, changing and transforming the content and structure of that field and constituting not an “art object,” but a continuously evolving and fluid system. These are the conditions of possibility of “database aesthetics.”, paraphrase: Artist Sharon Daniel, drawing from Bakhtin's concept of `dialogism,' sets off her `database aesthetics' in relation to what she calls `dialogic process.'  Dialogism is a concept that refers to the primacy of context over text, where ``everything means, is understood, as a part of a greater whole ---there is a constant interaction between meanings, all of which have the potential of conditioning others.'' (Bakhtin, The Dialogic Imagination). The extent of the implications of dialogism go far beyond the scope of my research. However, it is worth mentioning it to clarify Daniel's description of the database. She claims the database is a structure where ``all the possible meanings of stories, statements, images, and words interact, and possibly conflict, to affect and change their future meanings.' Thus, the dialogic aspect of the database is in very close connection with the concept of the archive, in which every insight of the archivist, every new writing about an archive extends and prolongs the archive even further. For Daniel, this dialogic process is rooted in social `interaction' and dialogue. Her emphasis on `narrative' in relation to databases will be dealt with later. For now, it is important to note that for Daniel, the dialogue and interaction produce a type of narrative that does not rely on any authorial consistency. Therefore, the fact that every process within database practices reaffirms the context upon which it is carried out, reveals these practices as dialog-based, or dialogic. Furthermore, Daniel stresses the fundamentally collaborative aspect of the database as a direct consequence of the interaction and dialogue: she calls these narratives `multi-vocal' and `author-less.' In sum, database systems are essentially collaborative, author-less ---she also qualifies it as `non-hierarchical'--- interactive, and dialogical. It is due to these qualities that she presents the database a an inherently all-encompassing field: ``A database incorporates contradiction; it is simultaneously recombinant and indexical, precise and scalable, immersive and emergent, homogeneous and heterogeneous.'' Although this array of categories build Daniel's foundation of an aesthetics of the database, there seem to be no limits to its scope. To what extent is the structure of the database simultaneously indexical and recombinant? That is, How flexible is its inner structure to allow for the sort of fluidity Daniel is suggesting? I agree when she places the agency of the aesthetic dimension of the database on the `traversing' of the field, that is, when the user, or database performer `activates' the `sub-fields' of the database, thus, in a way, transforming and creating still more `sub-fields' that are re-incorporated into the structure in a `continuously evolving and fluid system.' However, I argue that the internal structure of the database remains fixed, predetermined; and, as in any deterministic system, by containing a fixed internal structure, while the outcome might be multiple, and subject to perhaps uncountable trajectories, the fluid-like system is nevertheless predictable. This predictability is not necessarily a bad feature. On the contrary, it is a quality that was overlooked by Daniel, who in turn concentrated on the polyphony ---to use another one of Bakhtin's terms--- of narratives that comes through the performance of the database. Therefore, I would argue against the `evolution' of this fluid system ---that is, the database--- in any instance of a multimedia work on its own. This evolution, is not a quality of the database itself. The database can never evolve on its own. It is the performance of this evolution what makes the database unpredictable, in every new instance, in the globally dialogic database world that escapes the closed system of any particular database. The performance of the database makes it unpredictable, and thus is how the aesthetic dimension emerges from it. Daniel claims that the traversing of the database changes and transform `the content and structure' of its `fields,' which are given `ontological status.' This `ontological status' is only part of the condition of possibility of `database aesthetics.' Since the database is an inherently deterministic system, I consider the aesthetics of the database to reside in both the performing of its navigation and the performing of its construction, design, and programming. This is where the dialogic process resides ---if I am to adopt this word for a moment--- because the internal structure is a historical one, and in every programming decision there is the history of all previous logical designs, from the earliest computer designs, and likewise the condition for future navigational paths. However, once this decision has been made, the outcome is separated from its ability to affect its own history. And, as such, the database becomes a temporal being, subject to the linearity of time, and to the unbreakable paths of history., probs: 18 97 88 56 39 20 9 1 100 0 0 70 0 0 35 61 1 43 0 0 0 0 73 79 59 18 0 0 0 0 46 22 98 3 47 68 20 0, quoteid: 4/10/2018 4:45:51"},"link":[{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/1tMkdssQlN_wbGS1SjfORS7AOBspKvvun7_AvzxctMrE/5/public/values/dtbek"}],"gsx$timestamp":{"$t":"10/8/2018 19:18:21"},"gsx$quote":{"$t":"A database is relational and non-hierarchical.

Dialogism is a concept that refers to the primacy of context over text, where ``everything means, is understood, as a part of a greater whole ---there is a constant interaction between meanings, all of which have the potential of conditioning others.'' (Bakhtin, The Dialogic Imagination). The extent of the implications of dialogism go far beyond the scope of my research. However, it is worth mentioning it to clarify Daniel's description of the database. She claims the database is a structure where ``all the possible meanings of stories, statements, images, and words interact, and possibly conflict, to affect and change their future meanings.' Thus, the dialogic aspect of the database is in very close connection with the concept of the archive, in which every insight of the archivist, every new writing about an archive extends and prolongs the archive even further. For Daniel, this dialogic process is rooted in social `interaction' and dialogue. Her emphasis on `narrative' in relation to databases will be dealt with later. For now, it is important to note that for Daniel, the dialogue and interaction produce a type of narrative that does not rely on any authorial consistency. Therefore, the fact that every process within database practices reaffirms the context upon which it is carried out, reveals these practices as dialog-based, or dialogic. Furthermore, Daniel stresses the fundamentally collaborative aspect of the database as a direct consequence of the interaction and dialogue: she calls these narratives `multi-vocal' and `author-less.' In sum, database systems are essentially collaborative, author-less ---she also qualifies it as `non-hierarchical'--- interactive, and dialogical. It is due to these qualities that she presents the database a an inherently all-encompassing field: ``A database incorporates contradiction; it is simultaneously recombinant and indexical, precise and scalable, immersive and emergent, homogeneous and heterogeneous.'' Although this array of categories build Daniel's foundation of an aesthetics of the database, there seem to be no limits to its scope. To what extent is the structure of the database simultaneously indexical and recombinant? That is, How flexible is its inner structure to allow for the sort of fluidity Daniel is suggesting? I agree when she places the agency of the aesthetic dimension of the database on the `traversing' of the field, that is, when the user, or database performer `activates' the `sub-fields' of the database, thus, in a way, transforming and creating still more `sub-fields' that are re-incorporated into the structure in a `continuously evolving and fluid system.' However, I argue that the internal structure of the database remains fixed, predetermined; and, as in any deterministic system, by containing a fixed internal structure, while the outcome might be multiple, and subject to perhaps uncountable trajectories, the fluid-like system is nevertheless predictable. This predictability is not necessarily a bad feature. On the contrary, it is a quality that was overlooked by Daniel, who in turn concentrated on the polyphony ---to use another one of Bakhtin's terms--- of narratives that comes through the performance of the database. Therefore, I would argue against the `evolution' of this fluid system ---that is, the database--- in any instance of a multimedia work on its own. This evolution, is not a quality of the database itself. The database can never evolve on its own. It is the performance of this evolution what makes the database unpredictable, in every new instance, in the globally dialogic database world that escapes the closed system of any particular database. The performance of the database makes it unpredictable, and thus is how the aesthetic dimension emerges from it. Daniel claims that the traversing of the database changes and transform `the content and structure' of its `fields,' which are given `ontological status.' This `ontological status' is only part of the condition of possibility of `database aesthetics.' Since the database is an inherently deterministic system, I consider the aesthetics of the database to reside in both the performing of its navigation and the performing of its construction, design, and programming. This is where the dialogic process resides ---if I am to adopt this word for a moment--- because the internal structure is a historical one, and in every programming decision there is the history of all previous logical designs, from the earliest computer designs, and likewise the condition for future navigational paths. However, once this decision has been made, the outcome is separated from its ability to affect its own history. And, as such, the database becomes a temporal being, subject to the linearity of time, and to the unbreakable paths of history."},"gsx$probs":{"$t":"18 97 88 56 39 20 9 1 100 0 0 70 0 0 35 61 1 43 0 0 0 0 73 79 59 18 0 0 0 0 46 22 98 3 47 68 20 0"},"gsx$quoteid":{"$t":"4/10/2018 4:45:51"}},{"id":{"$t":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/1tMkdssQlN_wbGS1SjfORS7AOBspKvvun7_AvzxctMrE/5/public/values/dupz1"},"updated":{"$t":"2018-11-01T06:37:35.837Z"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006","term":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006#list"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"10/10/2018 12:01:45"},"content":{"type":"text","$t":"quote: \u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe  first explores the openness and immersive resonance of the sonic medium and its relationship to sharing, exposure and exchange, as well as to partitions of sense that are not guided or regulated by any signifying dogma.

By allowing listeners to be exposed to one another, in contact with themselves through the medium, the resonance of the sonic medium trespasses the material limits of their senses. This is also understood in terms of the reaching of the limits of the listening body. The listening subject, while becoming space ---that is, while it begins to resonate like the medium itself---, and it opens up the listening subject to a form of sharing, exchange, and ultimately community. This space of community is, as interpreted by Kane? in The Nancy Reader, an exposure to ``partitions of sense that are not regulated by any signifying dogma.' What this means is precisely that by being `opened,' the entire realm of the senses is fragmented allowing for places in which beings ---or singular beings, as Nancy suggests--- can be brought to contact with each other, understanding `touch' in a broader sense, one that permits being in common with the other. This is Nancy's take on community, and it is exemplified by sound, by resonance, and it is thus the type of listening that he is aiming for.\n\nThe music dimension of the concept of resonance, on the other hand, is of a different sort. Kane? interprets Nancy's concept of music as a succession of `musical attacks.' This rhythmical understanding of musical moments succeeding and `penetrating' each other in continuous `deference' of the moment of closure ---of meaning or sense---, constitutes the musical work. It is through this constitution that the work of music comes to exemplify Nancy's concept of resonance. Kane? claims that ``the work is not to be understood as an intentional object but as continually held open by each of its parts, allowing its sense to be exposed.''  Thus, like the listening subject in its state of fragmentation, the music work is an interrupted but ongoing process that resonates: with its own resonating mode of propagation; with its own medium; and, with its own listening experience.\nFinally, the concept of the `work' loses its validity if we are to understand music work as resonance. This is why I prefer music `unwork' to music work: in order for community to take place, the above mentioned notion of resonance ---which came later in Nancy's texts--- needs to be understood in terms of the `unworking' that Nancy elaborates on his ``The Inoperative Community.'' While this concept of inoperativity is dealt elsewhere in my text, it is relevant here to mention that all the above definitions of resonance affect equally the concept of inoperativity as set forth by Nancy in the early 80's. \n\nIt is through this inoperance that Nancy encounters meaning in the threshold between a mode of `signification’ and a mode of `sensibility’ that music presents to the listening experience. While arguing for an impossibility of understanding in either mode, Nancy speaks of listening as an `exposure to sense' ---an `exposure' as explained above--- in the ‘distance between sound and sense’ (L, 58). Kane? describes this distance in a temporal manner when he claims it consists of  ``deferring and challenging the moment when sense is overlaid with signification.'' Thus, the delay or deference between sound and sense is where the listening subject resides in its search for music understanding, which in turn is an inevitably incomplete activity that nevertheless provides the space for a temporal exposure to sense. \n\nIt is this latter quality of exposure to sense what makes Nancy refer to music as the `ineffable,' placing his philosophy of music perception in the same line as Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Jankélevitch, and Deleuze. The ineffable, in their terms, defines the power of music, unlike and above all other arts, of accessing ``realms of being that are incapable of being articulated in images and words.'' This is music's greatest and most dangerous quality, as Kane? suggests: ``the expansive, sensational, ineffable and immersive qualities of sound can become the tool of a powerful ideology.'' It is thus how Nancy locates the social agency of music, through its close relationship with affect; likewise, Kane? explains, it is in the imposition of signification onto the sensibility of music that the political use of music emerges. This is why Nancy suggests that music finds ways to ``listen to itself'' (L, xx), to make room not for an imposed signification, but to a resonating sensibility coming from music itself, as an agent in its own listening. For Nancy, therefore, music is a listening subject in its own right, and like such, it resonates with other listening subjects like ourselves. Therefore, the dynamic practice of listening that Nancy advocates in ``Listening,'' which I link in a way to his earlier ``The Inoperative Community,'' is, as Kane? suggests, an``indirect and complex form of open-ended self-relation,'' equally demanding attentiveness and rejection of any established dogmatism. It is under this conception of listening as resonance that the ontology of music acquires the type of agency that comes from its unworking; an agency that, when listened to, has the form and the politics of a music listening to itself., probs: 0 93 87 0 10 100 0 49 0 0 0 29 53 39 0 0 100 0 0 0 100 11 0 29 11 0 72 0 100 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 100 0, quoteid: 4/15/2018 6:16:32"},"link":[{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/1tMkdssQlN_wbGS1SjfORS7AOBspKvvun7_AvzxctMrE/5/public/values/dupz1"}],"gsx$timestamp":{"$t":"10/10/2018 12:01:45"},"gsx$quote":{"$t":"\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe  first explores the openness and immersive resonance of the sonic medium and its relationship to sharing, exposure and exchange, as well as to partitions of sense that are not guided or regulated by any signifying dogma.

I argue that since this historical conception of meaning in art is no longer in place due to what I call the `resonating network,' there is thus a new role for agency that opens uncharted spaces for signification which come from the listening-to-itself of the authorial, aesthetic, and interactive network that multimedia unworks reveal."},"gsx$probs":{"$t":"77 91 93 0 62 26 35 0 42 0 0 28 58 18 0 0 69 0 80 0 36 0 56 70 0 31 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 48 0 0 51 0"},"gsx$quoteid":{"$t":"11/6/2017 15:15:13"}},{"id":{"$t":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/1tMkdssQlN_wbGS1SjfORS7AOBspKvvun7_AvzxctMrE/5/public/values/ea67k"},"updated":{"$t":"2018-11-01T06:37:35.837Z"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006","term":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006#list"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"10/16/2018 5:13:06"},"content":{"type":"text","$t":"quote: The nonhuman turn, on the other hand, insists (to paraphrase Latour) that “we have never been human” but that the human has always coevolved, coexisted, or collaborated with the nonhuman—and that the human is characterized precisely by this indistinction from the nonhuman....
