INSTRUCTIONS FOR GITHUB PUSHES ON BRANCH <0.01> (ON TERMINAL)

1. First time only, getting the branch (on terminal):

   --> this will create a directory <fd_lib> with the branch <0.01>
   $ git clone -b 0.01 http://github.com/fedecamarahalac/fd_lib fd_lib

2. Updating the code:
   --> edit/update all you want in <fd_lib> (i.e., save pd files, code, etc)

3. Push to the branch (on terminal):
   $ cd fd_lib
   $ git init

   --> this will show you what you have actually edited
   $ git status

   --> choose what you want to commit and add it like this
   $ git add <file1>
   $ git add <dir/file2>

   --> (optionally for all your files) $ git add .

   --> make sure you are adding to the right remote site
   $ git remote add origin http://github.com/fedecamarahalac/fd_lib
   $ git remote -v

   --> finally, the push is done to the branch <0.01>
   $ git push -u origin 0.01

That's it!
