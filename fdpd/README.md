work with 2 interconnected instances of Pd 

get Gem here: http://gem.iem.at

get Pd here: http://msp.ucsd.edu

Just open 'fdpd.command' by clicking or CMD+O or  ./fdpd.command


 This shell script allows the user to work with 2 interconnected instances of PD
 via netsend and netreceive, the former handling audio (main-audio.pd) and the 
 latter handling VIDEO (main-video.pd). Both files are created in the "/bin" 
 directory. Once the "/bin" directory has been created, it only opens the files in
 different instances of Puredata.

 one provided here
